\section*{Description}

Re-\/create the famous Wa-\/\+Tor program in C++ and then optimised it with thread parallelism

\section*{Setup}

We decided to use the S\+F\+ML graphics library over just Open\+GL alone as it gives more options.

To install S\+F\+ML on U\+B\+U\+N\+TU\+:

sudo apt-\/get install libsfml-\/dev

Download S\+F\+ML, Open the downloaded directory in terminal, enter\+:

sudo cp -\/r include/\+S\+F\+ML /usr/include

sudo cp -\/r /lib/$\ast$ /usr/lib

sudo cp -\/r share/\+S\+F\+ML /usr/share

This will add the libraries to your H\+DD and allow you to compile the Wa-\/\+Tor program.

\section*{Run}

To compile the programe, open a terminal in the working directory and enter the command \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} and then \char`\"{}./main\char`\"{}

To remove all of the object files in the working directory, use the command \char`\"{}make C\+L\+E\+A\+N\char`\"{} in the terminal.

+\# chmod 755 ./profile.sh first to run this file via command line +\# This file will clean, build and run the program and produce a valgrind profiling report +\# on compleation the valgrind report can be viewed with kcachegrind G\+UI tool +\# To install profiling tools\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item +\# sudo apt-\/get update +\# sudo apt install valgrind +\# sudo apt install kcachegrind
\end{DoxyItemize}

see profile.\+sh for more info

\#\+Create Doxygen

If you type \textquotesingle{}make D\+OC\textquotesingle{} in a terminal in the working directory, the make file will compile the Doxygen code and it will display the Doxygen via Mozilla Firefox.

\#\+Debugging

If you type \textquotesingle{}make D\+E\+B\+UG\textquotesingle{} in to the terminal in the working directory you can enter debug mode.
